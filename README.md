# Morph

This mod started out as a small script to "morph" players by changing them into monsters, items, and increasing/decreasing their size (DrawScale).

It has since grown in size with other goofy/fun ideas, including:

* giving other players cheat commands such as "fly", "ghost", and "god"
* making other players send messages and voice/movement taunts
* instant teleporting to crosshair
* turning players into light sources
* spawning an army of mini Xan bots

This mod was made for the sole purpose of goofing around, and uploaded in the hope that it may help others learn more about UnrealScript. Made with ❤️.

Enjoy.
